# Testcase Example:  '"leetscode"\n["leet","code","leetcode"]'
#
# You are given a 0-indexed string s and a dictionary of words dictionary. You
# have to break s into one or more non-overlapping substrings such that each
# substring is present in dictionary. There may be some extra characters in s
# which are not present in any of the substrings.
#
# Return the minimum number of extra characters left over if you break up s
# optimally.
#
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: s = "leetscode", dictionary = ["leet","code","leetcode"]
# Output: 1
# Explanation: We can break s in two substrings: "leet" from index 0 to 3 and
# "code" from index 5 to 8. There is only 1 unused character (at index 4), so
# we return 1.
#
#
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: s = "sayhelloworld", dictionary = ["hello","world"]
# Output: 3
# Explanation: We can break s in two substrings: "hello" from index 3 to 7 and
# "world" from index 8 to 12. The characters at indices 0, 1, 2 are not used in
# any substring and thus are considered as extra characters. Hence, we return
# 3.
#
#
#
# Constraints:
#
#
# 1 <= s.length <= 50
# 1 <= dictionary.length <= 50
# 1 <= dictionary[i].length <= 50
# dictionary[i]Â and s consists of only lowercase English letters
# dictionary contains distinct words
#
#
#

# @lc code=start
# @param {String} s
# @param {String[]} dictionary
# @return {Integer}
def min_extra_char(s, dictionary)
  dp = Array.new(s.length + 1) { 0 }
  dictionary = dictionary.to_h { |i| [i, true] }
  # dictionary = Set.new(dictionary)

  (1..s.length).each do |i|
    dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + 1
    (0..i).each do |j|
      # if dictionary.include?(s[j...i]) && dp[j] < dp[i]
      if dictionary[s[j...i]] && dp[j] < dp[i]
        dp[i] = dp[j]
      end
    end
  end
